Top user agents
===============

Crawlers set their own name, also called product token, to find relevant groups of `allow` and `disallow` instructions. The product token (e.g. ExampleBot) is a substring of the User-Agent HTTP header. The following table lists the most frequently used product tokens in robots.txt files over the years. Note that for all further analysis of user agents we employ a case-insensitive comparison (`Bingbot` and `bingbot` are identical). The last column denotes the percentage of robots.txt files, which contain the respective product token.
